hi, I'm Ben. I'm currently a Junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and working towards my dream of becoming a quantative financial researcher/trader.
Some of my interests include finance, statistics, coding, American football, and anime. 
Looking to major in statistics and computer science at an undecided college.
